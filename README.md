# Panic Alarm System
This project presents the design and construction of a panic button alarm system for security emergencies which is used for real time monitoring of security emergencies such as theft, threat to life and property. The main objective of this project is to provide real time monitoring of different security emergency events and to provide location of distressed individuals through GPS mapping system using Google map. This project is achieved using ArduinoUno microcontroller which acts as the brain of the system where all instructions are carried out, Wi-Fi module which gives Wi-Fi access to the microcontroller and the security control centre , GPS module which gives location of push button when triggered by an individual in a threatening situation. This design saves time to contact security in times of security emergencies and can be deployed in rural areas where access to security is limited.
